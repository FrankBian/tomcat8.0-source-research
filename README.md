# Introduction

I got the source code of tomcat 8.0 , and compiled them by maven in Intellij IDEA 14.1.
Now, it can be used to import to intellij directly if you would like to read the source code .

# Structure

* catalina-home : binary distribution file
* tomcat-8.0-doc : full documentation
* tomcat-code : source code which you can check out via svn
