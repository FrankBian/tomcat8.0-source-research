# Introduction

I got the source code of tomcat 8.0 , and compiled them by maven in Intellij IDEA 14.1.  
Now, it can be used to import to intellij directly if you would like to read the source code .

# Structure

* [catalina-home](https://github.com/FrankBian/tomcat8.0-source-research/tree/master/catalina-home) : binary distribution file
* [tomcat-code](https://github.com/FrankBian/tomcat8.0-source-research/tree/master/tomcat-code) : source code which you can check out via svn
* [tomcat-8.0-doc](https://github.com/FrankBian/tomcat8.0-source-research/tree/master/tomcat-8.0-doc) : full documentation (this directory is optional)
* [PDF-resource](https://github.com/FrankBian/tomcat8.0-source-research/tree/master/PDF-resource) : the important resource to study tomcat source code (this directory is optional)  

___Just the `catalina-home` and `tomcat-code` must exist___
