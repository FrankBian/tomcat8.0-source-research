 * Data Filter<br>
 * Data filters are used to transform data as it is sent to a Channel.
 * Messages are filtered as the message is published to a channel, invoking the
 * {@link Channel#publish(Message)} method.<br>
 * This method gets invoked in two different scenarios, the first being when a message is received from
 * a remote client, and the Bayeux implementation invokes the publish method directly.
 * The second scenario is when a local client invokes {@link Channel#publish(Message)} directly in the local JVM.
